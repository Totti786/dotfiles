# Rofi-Zathura is a bash script that generates thumbnails and creates 
# shortcut desktop entries for documents in the Zathura document viewer,
# providing a convenient way to access and read PDF, EPUB, and CBZ files.

# Dependencies: evince-thumbnailer (for PDF and CBZ thumbnails)
#				gnome-epub-thumbnailer (for EPUB thumbnails)
#				zathura (document viewer)
#				rofi (application launcher)
